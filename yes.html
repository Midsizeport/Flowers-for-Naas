          <p>I stared into the abyss</p>
          <p>a window to your soul,</p>
          <p>a story untold.</p>
          <p>Like a black hole,</p>
          <p>It drew me inward</p>
          <p>and unveiled your hidden beauty.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Around it, a forest of oak,</p>
          <p>majestic, stripped bare,</p>
          <p>a place of peace</p>
          <p>where I lose myself</p>
          <p>and wish to linger,</p>
          <p>If only you didn't turn away.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Beyond the forest, an ocean of white,</p>
          <p>vast, unbroken,</p>
          <p>guiding all attention</p>
          <p>to your celestial eyes.</p>
          <br>
          <p>All this wonder</p>
          <p>rests within your almond gaze,</p>
          <p>a sanctuary of calm.</p>
          <p>Though you remain blind</p>
          <p>to its perfection.</p>
          <br>
          <p>It's time you opened your eyes, my love,</p>
          <p>and see the truth</p>
          <p>reflected in mine.</p>
